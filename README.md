# Euro_vs_Dollar_Exchange_Rate
A study of how holiday seasons affect the euro to dollar exchange rate.\
Inasmuch as the holiday shopping seasons have a significant impact on the economy, and the start of the holiday season is a day marked by a strong surge of shopping, one might intuit that the exchange rate changes as one country enters the holiday shopping season and the other does not. This notebook examines whether there is factual support for such a hypothesis.\
The dataset used was curated by Daria Chemkaeva and is from the European Central Bank and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020. The version used was downloaded in January 2021; howver, the dataset is constantly updated.
